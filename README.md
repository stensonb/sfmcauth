# SFMC Auth

This is a simple client meant to interface with OpenBSD's [authpf(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/authpf) (as described in the FAQ here: [https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/authpf.html](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/authpf.html))

On startup, if a keypair does not exist, one will be created.  The public key is displayed to the console.
